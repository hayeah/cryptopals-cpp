```
email=${emailString}&uid=10&role=user
```

* ECB encoding
* Can choose `emailString`

need to figure out the cipher text for `role=admin`

* find the block size
* use padding attack to find the content of the encoded string
* use `emailString` to figure out the block ciphertext for `"admin" + padding`
  * prefix + pad("admin", "0", blocksize) * 2
    * keep increasing prefix until a dup block is found
  * find roleUserCipherBlock
  * find roleAdminCipherBlock
* choose emailString to push the string i want to edit to the block boundary `role=[block boundary]user`
  * keep padding email until the `roleUserCipherBlock` pops out at the end
  * replace with `roleAdminCipherBlock`

# note

* roleUserCipherBlock padding must use same padding char as the oracle.
* the URL query encoding scheme should not encode `\04` otherwise there's no way for the padding attack to work.
